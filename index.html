            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve </p>
            <p>my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
                to start designing</p>
            <p>some ideas that for a long time I had only on
                paper and stored on my cell</p>
            <p>phone, I decided to look for some
                challenge, something that makes more</p>
            <p>sense with what I thought. I
                saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)</p>
            <p>made a daily user
                interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that</p>
            <p>the
                result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>
